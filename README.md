# About SHCF4J
The Simple HTTP Client Facade for Java (SHCF4J) serves as a simple facade or abstraction for various HTTP client frameworks (e.g. java.net.HttpURLConnection, Apache HttpClient, etc.) allowing the end user to plug in the desired HTTP client framework at deployment time. This library idea originated from the The Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) progect. More information can be found on the [SLF4J website](http://www.slf4j.org).
